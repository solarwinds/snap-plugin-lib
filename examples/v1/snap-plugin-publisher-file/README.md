## Snap Plugin Go Library: Publisher Plugin Example
Here you will find an example plugin that covers the basics for writing a publisher plugin.

## Plugin Naming, Files, and Directory
For your publisher plugin, create a new repository and name your plugin project using the following format:

>snap-plugin-[plugin-type]-[plugin-name]

For example: 
>snap-plugin-publisher-file


Example files and directory structure:  
```
snap-plugin-[plugin-type]-[plugin-name]
 |--[plugin-name]
  |--[plugin-name].go  
  |--[plugin-name]_test.go  
 |--main.go
```

For example:
```
snap-plugin-publisher-file
 |--file
  |--file.go  
  |--file_test.go  
 |--main.go
```

* The [plugin-name] folder (for example `file`) will include all files to implement the appropriate interface methods
* Your [plugin-name] folder  will also include your test files.


## Interface Methods

In order to write a plugin for Snap, it is necessary to define a few methods to satisfy the appropriate interfaces. These interfaces must be defined for a publisher plugin:


```go
// Plugin is an interface shared by all plugins and must be implemented by each plugin to communicate with Snap.
type Plugin interface {
	GetConfigPolicy() (ConfigPolicy, error)
}

// Publisher is a sink in the Snap pipeline.  It publishes data into another
// System, completing a Workflow path.
type Publisher interface {
    Plugin

    Publish([]Metric, Config) error
}
```


The interface is slightly different depending on what type (collector, processor, or publisher) of plugin is being written. Please see other plugin types for more details.



## Starting a plugin

After implementing a type that satisfies one of {collector, processor, publisher} interfaces, all that is left to do is a call the appropriate plugin.StartX() with your plugin specific options. For example with no meta options specified:

```go
	plugin.StartCollector(rand.RandCollector{}, pluginName, pluginVersion)
```

### Meta options

The available options are defined in [plugin/meta.go](/v1/plugin/meta.go). You can use some or none of the options. The options with definitions/explanations are below:

```go
// ConcurrencyCount is the max number of concurrent calls the plugin
// should take.  For example:
// If there are 5 tasks using the plugin and its concurrency count is 2,
// snapteld will keep 3 plugin instances running.
// ConcurrencyCount overwrites the default (5) for a Meta's ConcurrencyCount.
func ConcurrencyCount(cc int) MetaOpt {
}

// Exclusive == true results in a single instance of the plugin running
// regardless of the number of tasks using the plugin.
// Exclusive overwrites the default (false) for a Meta's Exclusive key.
func Exclusive(e bool) MetaOpt {
}

// Unsecure results in unencrypted communication with this plugin.
// Unsecure overwrites the default (false) for a Meta's Unsecure key.
func Unsecure(e bool) MetaOpt {
}

// RoutingStrategy will override the routing strategy this plugin requires.
// The default routing strategy is Least Recently Used.
// RoutingStrategy overwrites the default (LRU) for a Meta's RoutingStrategy.
func RoutingStrategy(r router) MetaOpt {
}

// CacheTTL will override the default cache TTL for the this plugin. snapteld
// caches metrics on the daemon side for a default of 500ms.
// CacheTTL overwrites the default (500ms) for a Meta's CacheTTL.
func CacheTTL(t time.Duration) MetaOpt {
}
```

An example using some arbitrary values::

```go
        plugin.StartCollector(
                mypackage.Mytype{},
                pluginName,
                pluginVersion,
                plugin.ConcurrencyCount(2),
                plugin.Exclusive(true),
                plugin.Unsecure(true),
                plugin.RoutingStrategy(StickyRouter),
                plugin.CacheTTL(time.Second))				
```

## Testing
For testing reference the [Snap Testing Guidelines](https://github.com/librato/snap/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#testing-guidelines). To test your plugin with Snap you will need to have [Snap](https://github.com/librato/snap) installed, check out these docs for [Snap setup details](https://github.com/librato/snap/blob/master/docs/BUILD_AND_TEST.md#getting-started).

Each test file should specify the appropriate build tag such as "small", "medium", "large" (e.g. // +build small).

For example if you want to run only small tests:
```
// +build small
// you must include at least one line between the build tag and the package name.
package rand
```

For example if you want to run small and medium tests:
```
// +build small medium

package rand
```

## Ready to Share
You've made a plugin! Now it's time to share it. Create a release by following these [steps](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/). We recommend that your release version match your plugin version, see example [here](/examples/v1/snap-plugin-publisher-file/main.go#L29).

Don't forget to announce your plugin release on [slack](https://intelsdi-x.herokuapp.com/) and get your plugin added to the [Plugin Catalog](https://github.com/librato/snap/blob/master/docs/PLUGIN_CATALOG.md)!
