# Testing

## Compile plugin

To build an executable file simply go to the folder containing written code (see: [Previous Chapter](/v2/tutorial/01-simple)) and execute command:
```
go build
```
Binary name depends on the folder in which `main` file is located. 

To force custom name of a binary, use:
```
go build -o binaryName
```

 Instead of compiling your own code, you can reuse tutorial example(s):
```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/solarwinds/snap-plugin-lib/tutorial/02-testing
go build
```

> Note:
> Further commands will use binary name based on the examples in tutorial folders (`01-simple`, `02-testing`, etc)
> For windows you probably should replace it with `01-simple.exe`, `02-testing.exe` etc. 

## Execution

### Smoke-test (No-argument provided)

The simplest way of validating plugin is to run binary without any arguments.
```bash
./02-testing
```

In a valid scenario collector should print out metadata information and quit after some time with an error message:
```
{"GRPCVersion":"2.0.0","Plugin":{"Name":"example","Version":"1.0.0"},"GRPC":{"IP":"127.0.0.1","Port":56302},"Profiling":{"Enabled":false,"Location":""},"Stats":{"Enabled":false,"IP":"","Port":0}}
time="2019-09-03T15:12:10+02:00" level=warning msg="Ping timeout occurred" layer=lib max=3 missed=1 module=plugin-rpc
time="2019-09-03T15:12:13+02:00" level=warning msg="Ping timeout occurred" layer=lib max=3 missed=2 module=plugin-rpc
time="2019-09-03T15:12:16+02:00" level=warning msg="Ping timeout occurred" layer=lib max=3 missed=3 module=plugin-rpc
time="2019-09-03T15:12:16+02:00" level=error msg="Major error occurred - plugin will be shut down" error="ping message missed 3 times (timeout: 3s)" layer=lib module=plugin-rpc
```

Observed scenario is valid. Executing without any arguments means that this plugin expects to be controlled by the snap daemon.
Since snap is not running (and not calling plugin with a keepalive-like "ping" operation), plugin will quit.

### Validating metric

Framework offers 3 way of validating metric collections:
1) running plugin in debug-mode
2) running plugin with snap-mock (minimal version of snap daemon)
3) running plugin with snap daemon (production)

This chapter will cover methods 1 and 2. 

#### Command-line arguments

You can execute plugin binary with some additional arguments. To list them you can simply call:
```
./02-testing -h
```

From the perspective of a plugin developer the most important options are:

|Flag                     | Description                                                                     |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -debug-mode             | Run plugin in debug mode (no snap daemon required)                              |
| -debug-collect-counts   | Number of collect requests executed in debug mode (0 - infinitely) (default 1)  |
| -debug-collect-interval | Interval between consecutive collect requests (default 5s)                      |
| -log-level              |  Minimal level of logged messages (you should use either `debug` or `trace`)    | 

> Other useful flags, like: `-plugin-config`, `-plugin-filter` and `*stats*` related will be discussed later. (see: [Stats](/v2/tutorial/05-tools#stats-server))
  
#### Debug-mode

To execute the collection, run binary in debug-mode.

```bash
./02-testing -debug-mode=1
```

It should generate output, similar to:
```
Gathered metrics (length=5):
example.date.day 3 {map[]}
example.date.month September {map[]}
example.time.hour 15 {map[]}
example.time.minute 58 {map[]}
example.time.second 53 {map[]}
```

Metric values depend on the current date and time and will differ on your testing environment, however the metric names should be the same.

You can request several collects, using other flags:
```bash
./02-testing -debug-mode=1 -debug-collect-counts=3 -debug-collect-interval=5s
```

Output will contain 3 sets of metrics calculated every 5 seconds:
```
Gathered metrics (length=5):
example.date.day 3 {map[]}
example.date.month September {map[]}
example.time.hour 16 {map[]}
example.time.minute 5 {map[]}
example.time.second 34 {map[]}

Gathered metrics (length=5):
example.date.day 3 {map[]}
example.date.month September {map[]}
example.time.hour 16 {map[]}
example.time.minute 5 {map[]}
example.time.second 39 {map[]}

Gathered metrics (length=5):
example.date.day 3 {map[]}
example.date.month September {map[]}
example.time.hour 16 {map[]}
example.time.minute 5 {map[]}
example.time.second 44 {map[]}
```

#### Running plugin with snap-mock

Debug mode should be sufficient in the majority of cases; nevertheless it is possible that running with a snap-mock will enable additional testing capabilities.

To work correctly plugin should be run with the following flags:
```bash
./02-testing -grpc-ping-max-missed=0 -grpc-port=50123
```

By providing `-grpc-ping-max-missed=0`, plugin will not exit when 3 pings are not received from snap (or its equivalent, like snap-mock).

Now, in other console, you should locate snap-mock, compile it and execute:

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/solarwinds/snap-plugin-lib/v2/snap-mock
go build
./snap-mock -collector-port=50123 -max-collect-requests=3 -collect-interval=5s -send-kill=1
```

> Make sure that `-grpc-port` (provided for plugin) and `-collector-port` (provided for snap-mock) are the same.

> `-send-kill` flag causes both, plugin and snap-mock, to complete with an execute.

Output of snap-mock:

```

What we can notice in the debug logs:
- GRPC `Collect()` was called 3 times, every 5 seconds 
- Plugin receives GRPC Ping periodically (`"GRPC Ping() received"`)
- GRPC `Kill()` is called at the end causing plugin to quit

There are also other entries:
- first line is metadata in JSON format used by snap. 
- GRPC `Load()` and GRPC `Unload()` calls will be covered later. In short, collection can be requested by several independent tasks and `Load()` allows to handle independent configuration for a single task. 
- `metrics chunk has been sent to snap` means that metrics are sent in portions to snap (generally to avoid some internal limits of GRPC when plugin want to send large portions of metrics)

As you can see we almost achieved the adequate testing results as in the debug mode (3 request every 5 seconds).
The difference is that with the current approach we trigger collection via GRPC API (the same way snap does), hence it's the same way plugin would be triggered in the production environment.  
Debug-mode calls defined methods internally (without utilizing GRPC communication), but it is sufficient in the collection logic validation.
Snap-mock will be useful in observing how a plugin reacts with different tasks (several configurations requested at the same time).
